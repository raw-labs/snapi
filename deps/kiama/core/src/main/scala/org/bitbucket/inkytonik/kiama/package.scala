/**
 * Kiama is a Scala library for language processing. It is a project of the
 * Programming Languages Research Group at Macquarie University. For full
 * project details see the web site `http://github.com/inkytonik/kiama`.
 *
 * Kiama's main components address tree decoration via attribute grammars
 * (package `attribution`), tree transformation via strategic term rewriting
 * (package `rewriting`), dynamic semantics (package `machine`) and
 * pretty-printing (package `output`).
 *
 * The `util` package contains support modules for parsing,  input/output,
 * read-eval-print loops (REPLs) and pattern matching.
 *
 * The `examples` package (available as part of the Kiama tests) contains
 * many examples of using Kiama to solve small to medium language processing
 * problems.
