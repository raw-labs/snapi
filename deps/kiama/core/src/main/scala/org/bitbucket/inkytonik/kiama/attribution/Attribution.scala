/**

 * with attribute values cached so that each value is computed at most once.
 * Use an instance of this module to encapuslate related attributes.
 *
 * You should ensure that more than one circular
 * attribute evaluation from a single module is not executing at the
 * same time because the current implementation has shared state between
 * related circular attributes. If your attributes are unrelated (i.e.,
 * can't possibly call each other) you should base them on different
