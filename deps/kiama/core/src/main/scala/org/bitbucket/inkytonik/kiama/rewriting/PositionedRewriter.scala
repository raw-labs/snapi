/**
 * Strategy-based term rewriting that copies positions to rewritten terms.
 * The positions are stored in a Kiama `Positions` object.
 *
 * Specifically, this kind of rewriter will record positions of nodes
 * when they are (a) rewritten as part of a generic traversal (e.g.,
 * `all`), or (b) rewritten as part of a `rule` or similar (e.g., `rulefs`).
 *
 * In each case both the start and finish positions of the old node are
 * copied across to the new node into which it is rewritten. In case (b)
 * no attempt is made to assign positions to nodes that represent sub-terms
 * of the term that results from a successful application of the rule.
 * Override the `rewriting` method to add more specific behaviour.
