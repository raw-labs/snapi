    <h2>Assignment One</h2>

    <h3>MiniJava Syntax Analysis</h3>

    <p>Due: 11am Monday 3 September (Week 6)<br>
      Worth: 10%</p>

    <p>This assignment asks you to develop a lexical analyser, parser
    and tree builder for a version of the Java programming language.
    We will build on these components in later assignments to build a
    full implementation of this Java version.</p>

    <p>Building this implementation will give you insight into the
    way that programming language implementations work in general,
    as well as specific experience with how Java is compiled and
    executed.</p>

    <p>This kind of task often arises in programming situations other
    than language implementation. For example, many applications have
    configuration files that are written in simple languages. The
    application must be able to read these files reliably and
    understand their structure, just as a compiler must read program
    files and understand them.</p>

     <p>Aspects such as checking the validity of names or
    types and translating the program into an executable form are beyond
    the scope of syntax analysis. We will address them in Assignments Two
    and Three.</p>

    <h4>MiniJava</h4>

    <p>Java is a very widely used object-oriented programming language.
    Building a compiler for the whole of Java is not feasible for a
    unit like COMP332. Instead, we will implement a cut-down version
    called <em>MiniJava</em>. This exercise will still require you to
    come to terms with the fundamental issues for progarmming language
    implementation, but within a more tractable setting.</p>

    <p>MiniJava is a strict subset of Java where programs contain a
    main class and some number of other classes. Classes can contain
    private field and public instance method declarations, but more advanced
    features such as visibility control, static methods and overloading
    are not present.
    The data types other than class instances are just integers, Booleans
    and integer arrays.
    Expressions are restricted to basic operations on integers, Booleans
    and arrays, plus calling instance methods. Allowed statements are
    assignment, conditionals, while loops and blocks. There is no
    mechanism for input, so data must be encoded in the program. Output
    is restricted to calling <code>System.out.println</code>.</p>

    <p>As an example, here is a simple factorial calculation implemented
    in MiniJava:</p>

<pre>
  class Factorial {
      public static void main () {
          System.out.println (new Fac ().ComputeFac (10));
      }
  }

  class Fac {
      public int ComputeFac (int num) {
          int num_aux;
          if (num < 1)
              num_aux = 1;
          else
              num_aux = num * (this.ComputeFac (num - 1));
          return num_aux;
      }
  }
</pre>

    <p>You can find more information about MiniJava at the
    <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/#progs">web site of the Modern Compiler Implementation in Java textbook</a>.
    In particular, that site features some more MiniJava programs
    that you might find useful. They are also included in the
    <code>test</code> directory of the assignment skeleton,
    modified to remove the main argument array, since we are not
    handling that in this assignment.</p>

    <p>Note that the implementation approach used in that textbook
    is not the same as the one we will be using in our assignments.
    In particular, that textbook follows an approach that uses some
    tools and hand-codes the rest of the compiler in Java. In contrast,
    we will write our implementations in Scala using the Scala and
    Kiama libraries, without any tools other than sbt and the Scala
    compiler.</p>

     <h4>What you have to do</h4>

     <p>You have to write, document and test a Scala lexical analyser,
     parser and tree builder for MiniJava as described below. There is
     one part for each of two passing assessments standards: a) P and Cr,
     and b) D and HD, with part (b) requiring more independent work
     than part (a).</p>

     <p>You are strongly advised to complete each part of the
     assignment before moving onto the next one. In fact, within each
     part it is advisable to solve small portions at a time rather
     than trying to code the whole solution in one go.</p>

<h4>The syntax of MinJava</h4>

       <p>To guide your implementation, here is a complete
       context-free grammar for the MiniJava language</p>

<pre>
  Program           : MainClass ClassDeclaration*.

  MainClass         : "class" Identifier "{"
                          "public" "static" "void" "main" "(" ")" "{"
                              Statement
                          "}"
                      "}".

  ClassDeclaration  : "class" Identifier ("extends" Identifier)? {"
                           VarDeclaration*
                           MethodDeclaration*
                      "}".

  VarDeclaration    : Type Identifier ";".

  MethodDeclaration : "public" Type Identifier "(" Arguments ")" "{"
                          VarDeclaration*
                          Statement*
                          "return" Expression ";"
                      "}".

  Arguments         : Type Identifier ("," Type Identifier)*
                    | /* empty */.

  Type              : "int"
                    | "boolean"
                    | "int" "[" "]"
                    | Identifier.

  Statement         : "{" Statement* "}"
                    | "if" "(" Expression ")" Statement "else" Statement
                    | "while" "(" Expression ")" Statement
                    | "System.out.println" "(" Expression ")" ";"
                    | Identifier "=" Expression ";"
                    | Identifier "[" Expression "]" "=" Expression ";".

  Expression        : Expression ("&&" | "<" | "+" | "-" | "*") Expression
                    | Expression "[" Expression "]"
                    | Expression "." "length"
                    | Expression "." Identifier "(" ExpressionList ")"
                    | Integer
                    | "true"
                    | "false"
                    | "this"
                    | Identifier
                    | "new" "int" "[" Expression "]"
                    | "new" Identifier "(" ")"
                    | "!" Expression
                    | "(" Expression ")".

  ExpressionList    : Expression ("," Expression)*
                    | /* empty */.
</pre>

<p>Note: in this syntax definition, the comment <code>/* empty */</code>
denotes an empty alternative.</p>

<p>The symbols <code>Integer</code> and <code>Identifier</code> are terminals
in this grammar. Both integer literals and identifiers match the longest
sequence of characters that they can.</p>

<p>An <code>Integer</code> comprises a sequence of one or more digits.</p>

<p>An <code>Identifier</code> comprises a sequence of characters that starts
with a letter and continues with zero or more letters, digits or underscores.
For the purposes of this assignment, you don't need to worry about identifiers
that look exactly like keywords. Just assume that they will not occur in the
input.</p>

<p>Whitespace does not contribute to the program structure, except to separate
symbols that would otherwise be merged without the whitespace. E.g., the
characters "onetwo" denote a single identifier, whereas the characters "one
two" denote two consecutive identifiers.</p>

<p>The binary operators <code>&&</code>, <code><</code>, <code>+</code>,
<code>-</code> and <code>*</code> are all left associative, except for
<code><</code> which is not associative. The binary operators have a precedence
order given by the previous sentence, from lowest to highest, except that
<code>+</code> and <code>-</code> have the same precedence.</p>

<h4>Part One (Pass and Credit, 74 marks): The main language</h4>

<p>The first part of the assignment involves building a syntax
analyser and tree builder for the MiniJava language as defined
above.</p>

<p>Your code must use the Scala parsing library as discussed in
lectures and practicals. You should use the expression language
syntax analyser and tree builder as a guide for your
implementation.</p>

<p>A skeleton sbt project for the assignment has been provided on
BitBucket as the <code>inkytonik/comp332-ass1</code> repository.
The modules are very similar to those used in the practical exercises
for Week 2 and 3. The skeleton contains the modules you will need.
Some of the parsing and tree construction is given to you as an
illustration; you must provide the rest (look for FIXME in the
code).</p>

<p>As well as lexing and parsing the input, your program should
construct a suitable source program tree to represent the parsed
result. See <code>MiniJavaTree.scala</code> in the skeleton for
the full definition and description of the tree structures that
you must use. For this part of the assignment, you should not
have to modify the tree classes, just create instances in your
parser code.</p>

<p>As an example of the desired tree structure, here is the
factorial program from above in source program tree form. Make
sure you understand this structure and the nodes in it, before
you start coding the assignment. This program does not use all
of the tree node classes.</p>

<pre>
  Program (
      MainClass (
          "Factorial",
          Println (
              CallExp (NewExp ("Fac"), "ComputeFac", List (IntExp (10))))),
      List (
          Class (
              "Fac",
              None,
              Nil,
              List (
                  Method (
                      IntType (),
                      "ComputeFac",
                      List (Argument (IntType (), "num")),
                      List (Var (IntType (), "num_aux")),
                      List (
                          If (
                              LessExp (IdnExp ("num"), IntExp (1)),
                              VarAssign ("num_aux", IntExp (1)),
                              VarAssign (
                                  "num_aux",
                                  StarExp (
                                      IdnExp ("num"),
                                      CallExp (
                                          ThisExp (),
                                          "ComputeFac",
                                          List (
                                              MinusExp (
                                                  IdnExp ("num"),
                                                  IntExp (1)))))))),
                      IdnExp ("num_aux"))))))
</pre>

<h4>Part Two (Distinction and High Distinction, 26 marks): Extending the language</h4>

<p>The second part of the assignment entails extending the language.
The aim is to give you some exposure to researching a language feature
and its syntax, then adding it to the syntax analyser and tree builder
implementation.</p>

<p>Specifically, you should devise an extension that supports the use
of <emph>interfaces</emph> in MiniJava programs. Consult any Java
available reference for information on Java interfaces. You should
support the definition of named interfaces that include signatures
(no bodies) for the methods that comprise the interface.</p>

<p>As well as determining an appropriate syntax for MiniJava interfaces
and recognising it in your parser, you must augment your tree definition
to contain whatever new classes you need to appropriately represent
interfaces in the source program tree. You should re-use existing
classes where it makes sense, but you will at least need a new class
to represent interfaces themselves.</p>

<p>Consult the teaching staff of the unit if you are in doubt about
what to include in your extension.</p>

<h4>Running the syntax analyser and testing it</h4>

The skeleton for this assignment is designed to be run from within sbt.
For example, to compile your project and run it on the file
<code>test/factorial.mj</code> you use the command

<pre>
  run test/factorial.mj
</pre>

<p>Assuming your code compiles and runs, this will print the tree that
has been constructed (for correct input), or will print a syntax error
message (for incorrect input).</p>

<p>The project is also set up to do automatic testing. See the file
<code>ParsingTests.scala</code> which provides the necessary
definitions to test the syntax analyser on some sample inputs. Note
that the tests we provide are <em>not</em> sufficient to test all of
your code. You must augment them with other tests.</p>

<p>You can run the tests using the <code>test</code> command in sbt. This
command will build the project and then run each test in turn,
comparing the output produced by your program with the expected
output. Any deviations will be reported as test failures.</p>

</ul>

<h4>What you must hand in and how</h4>

<ol>

    <li> <p>All of the code for your syntax analyser. To make this
    clear, submit <em>every file</em> that is needed to build your
    program from source, including files in the skeleton that you have
    not changed. Do not add any new files or include multiple versions
    of your files. Do not include any libraries. We will compile all
    of the files that you submit using sbt, so you should avoid any
    other build mechanisms.</p></li>

    <li><p>Your submission should include all of the tests that you have
    used to make sure that your program is working correctly. Note
    that just testing one or two simple cases is not enough for many
    marks. You should test as comprehensively as you can.</p></li>

     <li> <p>A type-written report that describes how you have
     achieved the goals of the assignment. Your report must contain
     the following components or sections:</p></li>

      <ul>

      <li>A title page or heading that gives the assignment details,
      your name and student number.</li>

      <li>A brief introduction that summarises the aim of the
     assignment and the structure of the rest of the report.</li>

      <li>A description of the design and implementation work that you
      have done to achieve the goals of the assignment. Listing some
      code fragments may be useful to illustrate your description, but
      don't just give a long listing. Leaving out obvious stuff is OK,
      as long as what you have done is clear. A good rule of thumb is
      to include enough detail to allow a student to understand it if
      they are at the stage you were at when you started work on the
      assignment.</li>

     <li>A description of the testing that you carried out. You should
     demonstrate that you have used a properly representative set of
     test cases to be confident that you have covered all the bases.
     Include details of the tests that you used and the rationale
     behind why they were chosen. Do not just print the tests out
     without explanation.</li>

     <li>If you attempted Part Two, include a description of your
     language extension sufficient to explain what you have added
     to the language syntax and to the tree structure.</li>

    </ul>

</ol>

<p>Submit your code and report electronically as a single zip file
called <code>ass1.zip</code> using the appropriate submission link on
the COMP332 iLearn website by the due date and time. Your report
should be in PDF format. DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR ASSIGNMENT OR DOCUMENTATION
IN ANY OTHER FORMAT THAN ZIP and PDF, RESPECTIVELY.</p>

<h4>Marking</h4>

<p>The assignment will be assessed according to the assessment
standards for Learning Outcomes 2, 3 and 4 as specified in the Unit
Guide.</p>

<p>Marks will be allocated equally to the code and to the report. Your
code will be assessed for correctness and quality with respect to the
assignment description. Marking of the report will assess the clarity
and accuracy of your description and the adequacy of your testing.
Marks allocated to testing will be 30% of the marks for the
assignment.</p>
