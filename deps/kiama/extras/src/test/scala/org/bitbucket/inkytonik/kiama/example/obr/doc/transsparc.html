    <h2>Obr Translation into SPARC Code</h2>

    This document describes

    <UL>
    <LI>the structure of the target trees used by the Obr compiler to represent
        SPARC target programs,
    <LI>the appropriate target constructs for the translation of each Obr source
        construct, and
    <LI>how to assemble and run the SPARC assembly language code.
    </UL>

    <P>The document concludes with examples of translations of a couple of
    simple Obr programs.</P>

    <P>The code that supports the tree structure and encoding described in
    this document can be found in <code>SPARCTree.scala</code> and
    <code>Encoder.scala</code> in the Obr compiler.  The mapping from Obr
    trees to SPARC trees can be found in <code>Transformation.scala</code>.</p>

    <h2>The SPARC Target Program Tree</h2>

    <p>All of the information that the translation task of the compiler
    provides about the target program is embodied in the target
    program tree.  If a particular item of information cannot be
    accessed via this tree, then it cannot be obtained at all.
    Information is encoded in the "shape" of the tree and in values
    stored at the leaves.</p>

      <p>This section defines the set of possible target program trees by
      defining all of the concepts and constructs of the target
      language.</p>

    <h3>SPARC Concepts</h3>

    <h4>Datum</h4>

    <p>A datum is a construct yielding an explicit value that can be
    stored or used as an operand for other operations. The encoder
    uses the attribute <code>reg</code> to associate a local machine
    register with each Datum to provide storage for the Datum's
    value; hence the transformation phase does not have to perform
    register allocation.</p>

    <h4>Item</h4>

    <p>An item is a construct that does not yield a value.</p>

    <h3>SPARC Constructs</h3>

    <p>A SPARC is a complete SPARC program. The SPARC node is the root
    of the target program tree, and never appears in any other
    position.</p>

    <p>The following productions summarise the constructs of the SPARC by
    giving the structure of the subtree for each construct.</p>

<pre>
SPARC:     SPARC: Item+ Int

Beq:       Item: Datum Label
Bne:       Item: Datum Label
Jmp:       Item: Label
LabelDef:  Item: Label
Read:      Item: Address
Ret:       Item
StW:       Item: Address Datum
Write:     Item: Datum

AddW:      Datum: Datum Datum
Cond:      Datum: Datum Datum Datum
CmpeqW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpneW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpgtW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpltW:    Datum: Datum Datum
DivW:      Datum: Datum Datum
IntDatum:  Datum: Int
LdW:       Datum: Address
MulW:      Datum: Datum Datum
NegW:      Datum: Datum
Not:       Datum: Datum
RemW:      Datum: Datum Datum
SubW:      Datum: Datum Datum

Local:     Address: Int
Indexed:   Address: Local Datum
</pre>

    <p>The "W" in some of the node names means that those operations
    operate on word-sized values (four bytes on the SPARC) which in
    this compiler are used to implement both integer and Boolean
    values.</p>

    <p>The following subsections describe the constructs of the table.
    Some of those constructs represent specific SPARC instructions and
    others represent collections of instructions that involve related
    decisions about operand access.</p>

    <h4>SPARC</h4>

<pre>
SPARC:     SPARC: Item+ Int
</pre>

    <p>The encoding of a SPARC construct depends on the assembler and
    operating system in use. The encoder will first encode a standard
    prologue to enable the operating system to invoke the generated
    code and establish memory space for the program's variables. The
    <em>Int</em> component of the SPARC node is the required maximum
    size for this storage in bytes. After the prologue the
    <em>Items</em> in the component list are encoded in order.
    Finally, a standard epilogue is encoded to enable return from the
    program to the operating system. This epilogue is begun by a
    standard label to enable the "Ret" construct (see below) to
    transfer control to it.</p>

    <h4>Branches</h4>

<pre>
Beq:       Item: Datum Label
Bne:       Item: Datum Label
Jmp:       Item: Label
</pre>

    <p>A branch (Beq or Bne) is encoded as the encoding of its
    <em>Datum</em> component followed by a test and branch to the
    <em>Label</em> component. A Beq does a branch on equal to zero and
    a Bne does a branch on not equal to zero.</p>

     <p>A Jmp does an unconditional branch to its <em>Label</em>
    component.</p>

    <h4>LabelDef</h4>

<pre>
LabelDef:  Item: Label
</pre>

        <p>A LabelDef construct represents a definition of a label and is encoded
        by emitting that definition in the appropriate assembler syntax.</p>

    <h4>Read, Write</h4>

<pre>
Read:      Item: Address
Write:     Item: Datum
</pre>

        <p>These constructs are encoded as calls to C library routines to
        read or write a single piece of integer data.  In the case of
        Read the value read is stored in the location given by the
        <em>Address</em> component.  In the case of Write the value written
        is that given by the <em>Datum</em> component which is encoded first.</p>

        <h4>Ret</h4>

<pre>
Ret:       Item
</pre>

        <p>A Ret construct is encoded by an unconditional jump to a
        label at the end of the code comprising the program (i.e., to
        the beginning of the epilogue). This encoding ensures that a
        return from any part of the program will complete necessary
        processing before exiting the program.</p>

        <h4>StW</h4>

<pre>
StW:       Item: Address Datum
</pre>

        <p>A StW construct is encoded by encoding the Datum component
        followed by an instruction to store the value of the Datum into
        the given address.</p>

        <h4>Arithmetic operations: AddW, DivW, MulW, NegW, Not, RemW, SubW</h4>

<pre>
AddW:      Datum: Datum Datum
DivW:      Datum: Datum Datum
MulW:      Datum: Datum Datum
NegW:      Datum: Datum
Not:       Datum: Datum
RemW:      Datum: Datum Datum
SubW:      Datum: Datum Datum
</pre>

    <p>Most of the arithmetic operations are encoded by encoding their
    <em>Datum</em> component(s) followed by a single instruction that
    performs the appropriate operation.</p>

    <p>The SPARC has no remainder instruction, so RemW constructs are
    encoded by a call to a C run-time routine that implements integer
    remainder.</p>

        <h4>Cond</h4>

<pre>
Cond:      Datum: Datum Datum Datum
</pre>

    <p>A Cond construct is encoded by encoding its first
    <em>Datum</em> component, followed by a sequence of instructions
    that evaluate the second <em>Datum</em> if the first <em>Datum</em>
    is non-zero, or evaluate the third <em>Datum</em> if the first
    <em>Datum</em> is zero. In either case the result value will be
    left in the location required by the Cond Datum itself.</p>

        <h4>Comparisons: CmpeqW, CmpneW, CmpgtW, CmpltW</h4>

<pre>
CmpeqW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpneW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpgtW:    Datum: Datum Datum
CmpltW:    Datum: Datum Datum
</pre>

    <p>The comparison constructs CmpeqW, CmpgtW, CmpltW, and CmpneW
    are encoded as the encoding of their operands, followed by a
    comparison instruction, followed by moves and conditional branches
    as appropriate to establish the result value of 0 or 1 in the
    location required by the comparison Datum.</p>

        <h4>IntDatum</h4>

<pre>
IntDatum:  Datum: Int
</pre>

    <p>An IntDatum construct is encoded as a move of the integer value
    into the location required by the Datum.</p>

        <h4>LdW</h4>

<pre>
LdW:       Datum: Address
</pre>

    <p>A LdW construct is encoded as a load of a word value from the
    location specified by its <em>Address</em> component into the
    location of the LdW.</p>

        <h4>Addresses: Local, Indexed</h4>

<pre>
Local:     Address: Int
Indexed:   Address: Local Datum
</pre>


    <p>A Local address represents a word-sized storage location in the
    main block of memory that is accessible to an Obr program. The Int
    component is the offset in bytes from the start of the memory block
    at which the word is located.</p>

    <p>An Indexed address is an address that is computed as a byte offset
    from a local address.  The offset is given by a computation expressed
    as a Datum.</p>

    <p>When an address is used in another construct (i.e., an LdW or an
    StW) it is first encoded, then used as an operand in the load or store.
    Local address do not produce any code when they are encoded.  Indexed
    addresses encode their Datum component.</p>

    <h2>Transforming Obr Source Trees to SPARC Target Trees</h2>

    <p>The results of the mapping process from source to target are
    reflected in the properties and structure of the target tree.
    This section describes how Obr source data and actions are mapped
    to target constructs.</p>

    <h3>Obr/SPARC Data Mapping</h3>

    <p>Obr programs can manipulate only integer and Boolean basic values
    plus structured values that are arrays and records.
    Both parameters and variables can be declared.
    Therefore, a definition of the data mapping task must specify how
    values of these types are implemented on the SPARC, and how
    storage is allocated for parameters and variables.</p>

    <p>Because there is no possibility of recursion in Obr, it is
    possible to implement data storage for parameters and variables
    statically.  The Obr "parameters" really aren't parameters at
    all---they are top-level variables that must be initialised by
    reading them from the standard input before executing the body of
    the Obr program.  Thus their storage is implemented just like
    variables.</p>

      <p>Obr constants do not need any storage since the compiler
      knows their value and can construct an IntDatum node that can be
      used directly.</p>

    <p>An Obr integer is implemented by a SPARC word (32 bits). For
    convenience, Boolean values are also represented by SPARC words.
    True is represented by one, and false is represented by zero.</p>

     <p>Storage for all of the variables declared in an Obr program is
    allocated in a single area of SPARC memory. During execution,
    register %l0 contains the address of the beginning of the memory
    area. Thus, any variable's location can be specified by the sum of
    a non-negative integer and the contents of register %l0. Since
    each variable occupies four bytes of memory, the offsets from the
    content of register %l0 are all multiples of 4: The topmost
    variable is in location [%l0], the next variable is in location
    [%l0+4], and so on.</p>

     <p>Arrays and records are allocated as contiguous memory as if
    the array elements or fields were declared as individual integer
    variables. (Recall that array elements and fields must be
    integers.) Therefore an array of N elements or a record with N
    fields is allocated as N contiguous words of memory.</p>

    <h3>Obr/SPARC Action Mapping</h3>

    Most of the Obr constructs map to SPARC constructs in an obvious
    way.  Some constructs do not generate any code (e.g, constructs
    like IntVar and ArrayVar that represent declarations).  This
    section describes how the other constructs are translated into
    SPARC target tree constructs.<p>

    <h4>Assignment</h4>

    <p>AssignStmt constructs are translated into a StW construct whose
    left child is the address of the variable, array element or field
    being assigned, and whose right child is the translation of the
    expression on the right-hand side of the assignment.</p>

    <h4>Boolean Expressions and Operations</h4>

    <p>A BoolExp is translated into an IntDatum where zero is used for
    FALSE and 1 for TRUE.</p>

    <p>AndExp and OrExp translate into uses of the Cond target
    construct in order to achieve short-circuit evaluation. They are
    translated as follows:</p>

<pre>
AndExp (e1, e2) -&gt; Cond (t1, t2, 0)
OrExp (e1, e2) -&gt; Cond (t1, 1, t2)
</pre>

    <p>In both of these translations t1 and t2 are the translations of
    e1 and e2, respectively.</p>

    <p>NotExp translates into a Boolean complement operation using the
    Not target construct.</p>

    <h4>Comparison Operations</h4>

    <p>The comparison operators EqualExp, NotEqualExp, GreaterExp,
    and LessExp are translated to the CmpeqW, CmpneW, CmpgtW and
    CmpltW constructs, respectively.</p>

    <h4>ExitStmt</h4>

    <p>An ExitStmt is implemented by a jump to the terminating label
    of the closest containing LoopStmt. See also the description of
    the LoopStmt construct below.</p>

    <h4>FieldExp</h4>

        <p>A FieldExp translates to a LdW from the address of the given
        record field.</p>

    <h4>ForStmt</h4>

    <p>A ForStmt construct is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre>
ForStmt (id, e1, e2, s) -&gt;
    StW (idmem, t1),
    StW (mem, t2),
    Bne (CmpgtW (LdW (idmem), LdW (mem)), L2),
    Jmp (L1),
    LabelDef (L3),
    StW (idmem, AddW (LdW (idmem), IntDatum (1))),
    LabelDef (L1),
    i
    Bne (CmpltW (LdW (idmem), LdW (mem)), L3),
    LabelDef (L2)
</pre>

    <p>Here, i is the list of <em>Item</em> nodes that is the translation
    of s, t1 is the translation of e1, and t2 is the translation of
    e2.  idmem is the storage location being used for the variable id,
    and mem is a new integer memory location not used elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Note that this scheme avoids a problem if the maximum expression
    e2 evaluates to the maximum integer possible, because id is not
    incremented unless overflow cannot happen.</p>

    <h4>IdnExp</h4>

    <p>An IdnExp is translated into either an IntDatum containing the
    integer value of the identifier (if it denotes a constant), or a
    LdW from the location in which the variable is stored.</p>

    <h4>IfStmt</h4>

    <p>An IfStmt construct is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre>
IfStmt (e, s1, s2) -&gt;
    Beq (t, L1)
    i1
    Jmp (L2)
    LabelDef (L1)
    i2
    LabelDef (L2)
</pre>

        <p>Here, i1 and i2 are the lists of <em>Item</em> nodes that are the
        translations of s1 and s2, respectively, and t is the translation
        of e.</p>

    <h4>IndexExp</h4>

    <p>An IndexExp translates to a LdW from the address of the given
    array element.  In general, the index is not constant so it must
    be calculated as part of the address computation.</p>

    <h4>Integer Expressions and Arithmetic Operations</h4>

    <p>An IntExp is translated into an IntDatum whose value is the
    Int component of the IntExp.</p>

    <p>The arithmetic target constructs are used to implement the
    arithmetic operators (MinusExp, NegExp, ModExp, PlusExp, SlashExp
    and StarExp) in the obvious way. For example, PlusExp is
    represented by AddW, ModExp by RemW, and NegExp by NegW.</p>

    <h4>IntParam</h4>

    <p>Parameter declarations are always represented by IntParam
    constructs and are translated into a Read construct whose child is
    address of the storage allocated to the parameter.</p>

    <h4>LoopStmt</h4>

    <p>A LoopStmt construct is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre>
Loop (s) -&gt;
    LabelDef (L1)
    i
    Jmp (L1)
    LabelDef (L2)
</pre>

    <p>Here, i is the list of <em>Item</em> nodes that is the
    translation of s. L2 is a label that can be used as the
    destination of jumps implementing ExitStmt constructs within the
    loop.</p>

    <h4>ObrInt</h4>

    <p>The ObrInt construct is translated into a SPARC construct
    whose children are the <em>Item</em> nodes comprising the
    translation of its Declaration and Statement components. The SPARC
    node also is given an Int component to record the maximum size of
    storage used by the program.</p>

    <h4>ReturnStmt</h4>

    <p>The ReturnStmt construct is implemented by a Write construct
    whose child is the translation of the component Expression to be
    returned, followed by a Ret construct.</p>

    <h4>WhileStmt</h4>

    The WhileStmt construct is implemented as follows:

<pre>
WhileStmt (e, s) -&gt;
    Jmp (L1)
    LabelDef (L2)
    i
    LabelDef (L1)
    Bne (t, L2)
</pre>

    <p>Here, i is the list of <em>Item</em> nodes that is the
    translation of s, and t is the translation of e.</p>

    <h2>Going from SPARC Target Trees to SPARC Assembly Code</h2>

    <h3>Running Compiled Programs</h3>

    <p>The assembly language code produced by the Obr compiler can be
    assembled and run on SPARC machines such as pompeii in the
    Department of Computing. It is necessary to use the
    <code>gcc</code> command, since the Obr code uses
    <code>scanf</code> and <code>printf</code> from the C library. If
    <code>factorial.s</code> contains the code generated by the Obr
    compiler for the factorial program then you can compile and run it
    as follows on pompeii.</p>

<pre>
gcc -o factorial factorial.s
factorial
4
</pre>

    <p>This execution should print 24.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Examples</h3>

    <p>This section shows the complete SPARC target trees and assembly code that
    would be produced for the factorial and GCD Obr programs.</p>

<p>Consider the Obr version of Euclid's algorithm for calculating the greatest
    common divisor of two numbers. </p>

<pre>
PROGRAM GCD (x : INTEGER; y : INTEGER) : INTEGER;

BEGIN
    WHILE x # y DO
        IF x > y
            THEN x := x - y
            ELSE y := y - x
        END
    END;
    RETURN x
END GCD.
</pre>

<p>From this code, the Obr compiler generates the following target tree:</p>

<pre>
SPARC (List (Read(Local(0)),
             Read(Local(4)),
             Jmp(L1),
             LabelDef(L2),
             Beq(CmpgtW(LdW(Local(0)),LdW(Local(4))),L3),
             StW(Local(0),SubW(LdW(Local(0)),LdW(Local(4)))),
             Jmp(L4),
             LabelDef(L3),
             StW(Local(4),SubW(LdW(Local(4)),LdW(Local(0)))),
             LabelDef(L4),
             LabelDef(L1),
             Bne(CmpneW(LdW(Local(0)),LdW(Local(4))),L2),
             Write(LdW(Local(0))),
             Ret),
       8)
</pre>

<p>From this target tree, the encoder produces the following SPARC
assembly code. Note that the encoder includes the target constructs as
comments (starting with exclamation marks) to make the correspondence
clearer.</p>

   <p>From this code, the Obr compiler generates the following target tree:</p>

</pre>

   <p>From this target tree, the encoder produces the following SPARC assembly code:</p>
