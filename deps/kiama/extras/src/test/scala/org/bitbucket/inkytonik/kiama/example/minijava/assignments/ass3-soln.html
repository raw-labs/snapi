    <h2>COMP332 Programming Languages 2012<br>
  Assignment Three (Sample Solution)</h2>

    <p>This assignment concerned the design, development, testing, and
    documentation of a translator from MiniJava to the Java Virtual
    Machine. The skeleton for the assignment provided much of the
    translator implementation. We needed to finish it off by implementing
    the missing portions.</p>

    <p>The features that we had to be implement were:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>artihmetic operations (subtraction and multiplication)</li>
        <li>conditional and while statements</li>
        <li>Boolean constants (<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>)
            and operations (<code>and</code>, <code>not</code>), and
        <li>array creation, length, indexing and assignment.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The following discussion considers each one of these in turn.</p>

    <h3>Arithmetic operations</h3>

    <p>The skeleton already implemented addition by first translating the
    two operand expressions, then generating an <code>iadd</code>
    instruction. I followed the same scheme for the two missing operations.
    For example, for subtraction I use an <code>isub</code> operation as
    follows in <code>translateExp</code>.</p>

<pre>
case MinusExp (left, right) =>
    translateExp (left)
    translateExp (right)
    gen (Isub ())
</pre>

    <h3>Conditional and while statements</h3>

    <p>In the week 10 practical exercise we saw a simple scheme for
    translating conditional statements. The difference for this assignment
    is that the conditional statements have both then and else branches,
    whereas in the practical they only had one branch. It was easy to
    extend the scheme to accommodate the extra branch.</p>

    <p>The code I generate for a conditional statement first checks the
    condition, jumping to a label for the else branch if the condition
    is false. Otherwise, the code falls through to the code for the
    then branch, followed by a jump over the else branch. The code that
    was added to <code>translateStmt</code> is as follows.</p>

<pre>
case If (cond, stmt1, stmt2) =>
    val label1 = makeLabel ()
    val label2 = makeLabel ()
    translateCond (cond, label1)
    translateStmt (stmt1)
    gen (Goto (label2))
    gen (Label (label1))
    translateStmt (stmt2)
    gen (Label (label2))
</pre>

    <p>While statements are handled essentially the same as in the
    practical. The code first checks the condition and jump after the
    loop body if the condition is false. Otherwise, we fall through to
    the body followed by a jump back up to the top of the loop. The
    code is as follows.</p>

<pre>
case While (cond, stmt) =>
    val label1 = makeLabel ()
    val label2 = makeLabel ()
    gen (Label (label1))
    translateCond (cond, label2)
    translateStmt (stmt)
    gen (Goto (label1))
    gen (Label (label2))
</pre>

    <h3>Boolean constants and operations</h3>

    <p>As noted in the assignment handout, the JVM doesn't really have Boolean
    operations, so to translate MiniJava Booleans, we use integers, with the
    convetion that one is true and zero is false. Thus, the two cases for
    true and false in <code>translateExp</code> became:</p>

<pre>
case TrueExp () =>
    gen (Iconst_1 ())

case FalseExp () =>
    gen (Iconst_0 ())
</pre>

    <p>I chose to implement the Boolean <code>and</code> and <code>not</code>
    operations using flow control, rather than trying to find integer operations
    that had the desired effect. In the case of <code>not</code> it suffices to
    evaluate the operand expression, then use an <code>ifeq</code> instruction
    to jump to code to push one if the expression is zero. Otherwise, the
    code falls through to code to push zero and jump over the other code.</p>

<pre>
case NotExp (exp) =>
    val label1 = makeLabel ()
    val label2 = makeLabel ()
    translateExp (exp)
    gen (Ifeq (label1))
    gen (Iconst_0 ())
    gen (Goto (label2))
    gen (Label (label1))
    gen (Iconst_1 ())
    gen (Label (label2))
</pre>

    <p>The <code>and</code> operation can be handled in a similar fashion,
    but we need to take care to implement the short-circuit evaluation
    semantics. In other words, if the left operand expression evaluates to
    false, then we should not evaluate the right operand expression.</p>

    <p>The code first evaluates the left expression. If that expression is
    equal to zero, it jumps straight to code to push a zero (false) value
    as the result of the whole expression. Otherwise, if the left expression
    is true, the control falls through to code that evaluates the right
    expression.  No more work needs to be done, since at that point the
    value of the right expression is the same as the value of the whole expression,
    and that value is on the operand stack already. So, after the right
    expression has been evaluated, we just need to jump over the false
    code.</p>

<pre>
case AndExp (left, right) =>
    val label1 = makeLabel ()
    val label2 = makeLabel ()
    translateExp (left)
    gen (Ifeq (label1))
    translateExp (right)
    gen (Goto (label2))
    gen (Label (label1))
    gen (Iconst_0 ())
    gen (Label (label2))
</pre>

    <h3>Arrays</h3>

    <p>Arrays were a bit trickier than the other constructs, not because
    they were hard to generate code for, but because I needed to find the
    right instructions to deal with arrays. At this point it is worth
    noticing that the JVM has two sets of array instructions: one set
    for arrays of primitive values (e.g., integers) and another set for
    arrays of object references. MiniJava only has arrays with integer
    elements, so we only use the first set of instructions.</p>

    <p>First, array creation. For integer arrays creation is achieved by
    the <code>newarray</code> instruction where the argument is the
    primitive element type. When using Jasmin, we can specify the
    elementy type by name.  The number of elements that we want in the
    array must already be on the operand stack when the creation
    instruction is executed. Thus, in <code>translateExp</code> a new
    array expression is translated as follows.</p>

<pre>
case NewArrExp (exp) =>
    translateExp (exp)
    gen (NewArray ("int"))
</pre>

    <p>The length of an array is obtained by pushing the array reference
    on the operand stack and executing an <code>arraylength</code>
    instruction. Thus, the translation code for this case is:</p>

<pre>
case LengthExp (base) =>
    translateExp (base)
    gen (ArrayLength ())
</pre>

    <p>An array indexing operation requires the array reference and the
    index of the element which we want to obtain to both be on the
    stack (in that order). Then the <code>iaload</code> instruction
    replaces them with the requested element.</p>

<pre>
case IndExp (base, ind) =>
    translateExp (base)
    translateExp (ind)
    gen (Iaload ())
</pre>

    <p>Finally, in <code>translateStmt</code> we need to implement
    array assignment statements. These are implemented using
    <code>iastore</code> instructions, which expect the array
    reference, the index value and the value to be assigned to be
    on the stack (in that order). In an <code>ArrAssign</code>
    statement construct the array is given by an identifier, so
    we use the skeleton's <code>translateIdnLoad</code> method to
    generate code to load the value of whatever that identifier
    refers to (since it might be a field, argument or local
    variable). Thus, the code to translate array assignments
    is as follows.</p>

<pre>
case ArrAssign (idnuse, ind, exp) =>
    translateIdnLoad (idnuse)
    translateExp (ind)
    translateExp (exp)
    gen (Iastore ())
</pre>

    <h3>Testing</h3>

    <p>I used two testing approaches for this asignment. First, for each
    of the constructs that I had to implement I created small MiniJava
    programs that uses these constructs in simple ways, trying to focus
    on one aspect of the construct at a time.</p>

    <p>I tried to get tests that tested all of the different possibilities
    for a construct. E.g, for the <code>and</code> expressions, we have
    three possibilities, depending on the truth value of the left and
    right expressions. Thus, there are three test cases to make sure that
    the possibilities are all covered. (The implementation of the basic
    Boolean values are also tested in these tests.)</p>

    <p>To illusrate the idea, consider the following test case:</p>

<pre>
class AndFalseLoop {
    public static void main () {
        System.out.println (false &amp;&amp; (new LoopClass ().run ()));
    }
}

class LoopClass {

    public boolean run () {
        while (true) {}
        return false;
    }

}
</pre>

    <p>This test is designed to test the short-circuit evaluation. An
    <code>and</code> expression is evaluated which has a false left
    operand and a right operand that goes into an infinite loop.
    Under short-circuit evaluation we expected to get false for this
    program, so the expected output is <code>0</code>.</p>

    <p>Similarly, for statements such as conditional or while statements,
    I have tests that make sure that all of the flow control possibilities
    are covered. E.g., for a while statement, we cover zero iterations of
    the loop, one iteration and more than one iteration.</p>

    <p>As a further illustration, we have the following test case which
    tests that loops that iterate more than once iterate the correct
    number of times. The expected output for this test is <code>10</code>.</p>

<pre>
class WhileMany {
    public static void main () {
        System.out.println (new WhileManyClass ().run ());
    }
}

class WhileManyClass {

    public int run () {
        int v;
        v = 0;
        while (v &lt; 10) {
            v = v + 1;
        }
        return v;
    }

}
</pre>

    <p>As well as using these small synthetic tests, I also tested my
    translator using the bigger MiniJava programs that were provided in
    the skeleton. These bigger tests are likley to exercise the
    translation much more than the simple cases, particularly using
    more complex operands for the expressions or bodies for the
    structured statements.</p>

    <p>I wrote a small script setup that runs my compiler over all of the
    tests in the test sub-directory, uses Jasmin to produce class files,
    runs the main program with the JVM, and captures the output from the
    run. That output is compared to the <code>.exp</code> file that
    belongs to the test and any difference is flagged as a test failure.</p>

    <p>In each case, I obtain the output that I expect to see, so I am
    reasonably confident that my translations are correct.</p>
