    <h2>Assignment Two</h2>

    <h3>MiniJava Semantic Analysis</h3>

    <p>Due: 11am Monday 8 October (Week 9)<br>
      Worth: 10%</p>

    <p>This assignment asks you to develop part of a semantic analyser for
    the MiniJava programming language. We will build on the work done in
    Assignment One, but will not support the interfaces that were added
    in Part Two of that assignment.</p>

    <p>Building this implementation will give you insight into the
    way that programming language implementations work in general,
    as well as specific experience with how Java is compiled and
    executed. All compiler or language processors must enforce the
    rules of the language. The semantic analyser enforces rules to
    do with naming and typing in particular. We only proceed to
    code generation if these rules are satisfied.</p>

    <p>We will build on the first two assignments in Assignment Three where we
    will add a simple code generator so that we can run our programs.</p>

    <h4>Updates from Assignment One</h4>

    <p>To support the semantic analysis tasks that we wish to carry out, it
    is useful to have a slightly different tree structure from that of
    Assignment One. This section outlines the changes. See the new version
    of <code>MiniJavaTree.scala</code> in the skeleton for details.
    The syntax analyser has been updated to use the new structure.</p>

    <ul>

    <li><p>Name analysis needs to treat defining and applied occurrences of
    identifiers differently. The easiest way to do this is to distinguish
    them in the tree structure. For MiniJava it is possible for the parser
    to locate them syntactically, since any single occurrence of an identifier
    is either a defining occurrence or an applied occurrence, but cannot
    be both. The new tree node types <code>IdnDef</code> and
    <code>IdnUse</code> are used to represent these two cases. They just
    contain the identifier string.</p></li>

    <li><p>The structure of the syntax tree is intimately related to the
    computations we perform on it. Since we will be dealing with naming
    scopes, we want a structure that makes it easy to identify where
    they begin and end. For this reason, classes and methods now have
    extra internal structure. All of the children that lie within the
    scope of a class or method are now located under a special
    <code>ClassBody</code> or <code>MethodBody</code> node inside the
    <code>Class</code> or <code>Method</code> node. Note that the
    defining identifier occurrence for the class or method is <em>not</em>
    inside the body, since it belongs to the outer scope.</p></li>

    <li><p>An expression of the form <code>arr.length</code> where
    <code>arr</code> is presumably an array, was previously represented
    in the tree by a <code>CallExp</code> node.
    Since the array length operation is special and not really like
    a normal method call, there is a new <code>LengthExp</code>
    kind of node for this purpose.</li>

    <li><p>The syntax tree has also been changed to use Kiama's support
    for annotating nodes with their source positions, since we will need
    that information when we report semantic errors. You can use any node
    as the first argument to Kiama's <code>message</code> method and
    its position will be used for the message.</p></li>

    </ul>

     <h4>What you have to do</h4>

     <p>You have to write, document and test a Scala semantic analyser
     for the MiniJava language, as described below. There is one part for
     each of two passing assessments standards: a) P and Cr, and b) D
     and HD, with part (b) requiring more independent work than part
     (a).</p>

     <p>You are strongly advised to complete each part of the
     assignment before moving onto the next one. In fact, within each
     part it is advisable to solve small portions at a time rather
     than trying to code the whole solution in one go.</p>

    <h4>MiniJava semantic rules</h4>

    <p>This section explains the rules of name and type analysis for
    MiniJava which you will need in the assignment. Some languages
    allow name and type analysis to be handled separately, but in
    Java-like languages they are intertwined since in an expression
    such as <code>o.m()</code> we need to know the meaning of the
    name <code>o</code> in order to work out that it's of a reference
    type and only then can we look up the name <code>m</code> in the
    referenced class to find out what it means.</p>

    <p>Basically, MiniJava names work as in Java, with some simplifications.
    Four different kinds of named entity exist: classes, methods, method
    arguments and variables. The whole program is a scope containing all of the
    normal classes. Each class has a scope nested within the program scope,
    containing all of the class's variables and methods. Each method has a scope
    nested within its class scope, containing all of the method's arguments and
    variables. Declared names are usable anywhere in the scope in which
    they are defined, not just from their declaration to the end of the
    scope.</p>

    <p>The main class is <em>not</em> represented by an entity like the
    normal classes, since the main class name cannot be used as a normal class
    name. The main class only exists as an entry point for the program.
    The expression <code>this</code> makes no sense in the main class,
    since it has no variables or methods, but we will not check this
    condition in this assignment.</p>

    <p>MiniJava variables and arguments can refer to values of type
    integer, Boolean, integer array or reference to an instance of a
    particular class. The first three types are represented by the
    syntax tree node types used in Assignment One. Reference types are
    represented by instances of the <code>ReferenceType</code> case
    class defined in <code>SymbolTable.scala.</code>.<p>

    <p>The full MiniJava semantic analyser phase must implement the following
    rules and check any associated conditions (but see below for what
    you need to do in the two parts of the assignment):<p>

    <ol>

    <li><p>There must be at most one defining occurrence of any name in
    a scope, not counting definitions in enclosing scopes.</p></li>

    <li><p>Each applied identifier occurrence must refer to exactly
    one defining occurrence. That defining occurrence is located by
    first looking in the innermost scope in which the applied
    occurrence occurs. If the defining occurrence is not located
    in the innermost scope, the search proceeds recursively to the
    smallest enclosing scope.</p>

    <li><p>If a defining occurence of an applied identifier is not
    found in the class in which that applied occurrence appears,
    and the class has a superclass, then the search moves to the
    superclass. If that class has no definition for the identifier
    and has a superclass, the search moves to that superclass.
    And so on until the definition is found or the superclass chain
    is exhausted.</p></li>

    <li><p>The type of an integer expression is integer.</p></li>

    <li><p>The type of a true or false expression is Boolean.</p></li>

    <li><p>The type of an identifier expression referring to a
    variable, argument or class is the declared type of the variable
    or argument (in the first two cases) or a reference type that
    refers to instances of that class (in the last case). Method
    names cannot be used by themselves in expressions; they can
    only be used in call expressions.<p></li>

    <li><p>The condition in an if-statement or while-statement must
    be of type Boolean.</p></li>

    <li><p>The expression in a println-statement can be of any type.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a variable assignment statement, the name on the left-hand
    side must refer to a variable or argument. The type of the expression
    on the right-hand side must be the same as that of the variable or
    argument.</p></li>

    <li><p>In an array assignment statement or index expression, the
    base sub-expression must be of integer array type and the index sub-expression
    must be of integer type. In the assignment case, the type of the
    right-hand side sub-expression must be integer. In the index expression
    case the type of the sub-expression is integer.</p>

    <li><p>In plus, minus and star expressions, the types of both
    sub-expressions must be integer. The type of the expression is integer.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a logical AND expression, the types of both sub-expressions
    must be Boolean. The type of the expression is Boolean.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a logical NOT expresion, the type of the sub-expression must
    be Boolean. The type of the expression is Boolean.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a less-than expression, the types of both sub-expressions must
    be integer. The type of the expression is Boolean.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a length expression, the type of the base sub-expression must be
    integer array. The type of the expression is integer.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a method call expression the named entity that is being called
    must be a method of the class whose instance is referenced by the base
    expression (or in a superclass if that class has no method with the
    given name). The number of arguments supplied in the call and their
    types must be the same as the number of arguments and argument types
    required by the called method. The type of the expression is the return
    type of the method.</p></li>

    <li><p>The type of a <code>this</code> expression is a reference to an
    instance of the class in which the <code>this</code> expression occurs.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a new array expression the type of the sub-expression must be integer.
    The type of the new array expression is integer array.</p></li>

    <li><p>In a new instance expression the name used must refer to a normal
    class. The type of the expression is a reference to an instance of that
    class.</p></li>

    <li><p>The type of the return expression in a method must be the same as
    the declared return type of the method.</p></li>

    </ol>

<h4>Part One (Pass and Credit, 74 marks): The basic MiniJava semantic rules</h4>

<p>The first part of the assignment involves implementing and
testing the basic MiniJava semantic rules. Specifically, you
must implement rules 1, 2, 4-15 and 17-19 listed in the previous
section.</p>

<p>Your code must use the Kiama attribute grammar and environment libraries as
discussed in lectures and practicals. You should use the expression language
semantic analyser as a guide for your implementation, although note that
MiniJava is a much more complex language.</p>

<p>A skeleton sbt project for the assignment has been provided on BitBucket as
the <code>inkytonik/comp332-ass2</code> repository.  The modules are very
similar to those used in the practical exercises for Week 6 and 7.
For this assignment you should not have to modify any parts of
the implementation except the semantic analyser (<code>SemanticAnalysis</code>)
and the related tests (<code>SemanticTests.scala</code>).</p>

<p>Some of the semantic analysis and useful associated testing code is given
to get you started, including most of the basic environment handling; you must
provide the rest, particularly the implementations of the checks that enforce
rules (look for FIXME in the code for some places where new code has to go).</p>

<h4>Part Two (Distinction and High Distinction, 26 marks): The more complex semantic rules</h4>

<p>The second part of the assignment entails implementing and testing
the semantic rules that were not covered by Part One, i.e., rules 3,
16 and 20.</p>

<h4>Running the semantic analyser and testing it</h4>

The skeleton for this assignment is designed to be run from within sbt.
For example, to compile your project and run it on the file
<code>test/factorial.mj</code> you use the command

<pre>
  run test/factorial.mj
</pre>

<p>Assuming your code compiles and runs, this will print any semantic
errors that have been found. If no errors are detected, you will see
no output.</p>

<p>The project is also set up to do automatic testing. See the file
<code>SemanticTests.scala</code> which provides the necessary
definitions to test the semantic analyser on some sample inputs. Note
that the tests we provide are <em>not</em> sufficient to test all of
your code. You must augment them with other tests.</p>

<p>You can run the tests using the <code>test</code> command in sbt. This
command will build the project and then run each test in turn,
comparing the output produced by your program with the expected
output. Any deviations will be reported as test failures.</p>

<p>Running all of the tests can be time-consuming since it also runs
the parsing tests. To just run the semantic analysis tests you can use
the command <code>test-only *SemanticTests</code>.</p>

<h4>What you must hand in and how</h4>

<ol>

    <li> <p>All of the code for your semantic analyser. To make this
    clear, submit <em>every file</em> that is needed to build your
    program from source, including files in the skeleton that you have
    not changed. Do not add any new files or include multiple versions
    of your files. Do not include any libraries. We will compile all
    of the files that you submit using sbt, so you should avoid any
    other build mechanisms.</p></li>

    <li><p>Your submission should include all of the tests that you have
    used to make sure that your program is working correctly. Note
    that just testing one or two simple cases is not enough for many
    marks. You should test as comprehensively as you can.</p></li>

     <li> <p>A type-written report that describes how you have
     achieved the goals of the assignment. Your report must contain
     the following components or sections:</p></li>

      <ul>

      <li>A title page or heading that gives the assignment details,
      your name and student number.</li>

      <li>A brief introduction that summarises the aim of the
     assignment and the structure of the rest of the report.</li>

      <li>A description of the design and implementation work that you
      have done to achieve the goals of the assignment. Listing some
      code fragments may be useful to illustrate your description, but
      don't just give a long listing. Leaving out obvious stuff is OK,
      as long as what you have done is clear. A good rule of thumb is
      to include enough detail to allow a student to understand it if
      they are at the stage you were at when you started work on the
      assignment.</li>

     <li>A description of the testing that you carried out. You should
     demonstrate that you have used a properly representative set of
     test cases to be confident that you have covered all the bases.
     Include details of the tests that you used and the rationale
     behind why they were chosen. Do not just print the tests out
     without explanation.</li>

    </ul>

</ol>

<p>Submit your code and report electronically as a single zip file
called <code>ass2.zip</code> using the appropriate submission link on
the COMP332 iLearn website by the due date and time. Your report
should be in PDF format. DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR ASSIGNMENT OR DOCUMENTATION
IN ANY OTHER FORMAT THAN ZIP and PDF, RESPECTIVELY.</p>

<h4>Marking</h4>

<p>The assignment will be assessed according to the assessment
standards for Learning Outcomes 2, 3 and 4 as specified in the Unit
Guide.</p>

<p>Marks will be allocated equally to the code and to the report. Your
code will be assessed for correctness and quality with respect to the
assignment description. Marking of the report will assess the clarity
and accuracy of your description and the adequacy of your testing.
Marks allocated to testing will be 30% of the marks for the
assignment.</p>
