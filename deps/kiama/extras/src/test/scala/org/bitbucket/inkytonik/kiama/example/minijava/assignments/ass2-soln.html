    <h2>COMP332 Programming Languages 2012<br>
  Assignment Two (Sample Solution)</h2>

    <p>This assignment concerned the design, development, testing, and
    documentation of a semantic analyser for a simple MiniJava version of
    the Java programming language. We had to implement checks for a
    variety of semantic conditions, mostly involving naming and typing.
    Also, we had to design test cases to demonstrate that our
    implementation is working correctly.</p>

    <p>This report presents the design and implementation of my semantic
    analyser and describes the design of the tests I have used to
    check the correctness of the implementation. Parts One and Two are
    discussed separately. The full code for this sample solution is on
    the COMP332 iLearn site.</p>

    <h3>Part One: The basic MiniJava semantic rules</h3>

    <p>This part of the assignment required us to implement rules
    1, 2, 4-15 and 17-19 as specified in the handout. In the following
    I consider each rule in turn, discussing how each of them was
    implemented. Testing is considered in the final sub-section.</p>

    <p><em>Rule 1: There must be at most one defining occurrence of any name
    in a scope, not counting definitions in enclosing scopes.</em></p>

    <p><em>Rule 2: Each applied identifier occurrence must refer to exactly
    one defining occurrence. That defining occurrence is located by first
    looking in the innermost scope in which the applied occurrence occurs.
    If the defining occurrence is not located in the innermost scope, the
    search proceeds recursively to the smallest enclosing scope.</em></p>

    <p>Rules 1 and 2 were already implemented in the skeleton since that code
    built an environment for each node of the tree, containing just the
    named entities that are visible at that node. The <code>check</code>
    method already contained checks for undefined and multiply-defined
    entities.</p>

    <p><em>Rule 4: The type of an integer expression is integer.</em></p>

    <p>This rule required examination of the <code>tipe</code> attribute,
    which returns the type of an expression node. The skeleton implementation
    of the attribute already contained a case for this rule.</p>

    <p>For this rule and others concerning the type of expressions and their
    expected type I also needed to augment the <code>check</code> method with
    a case to check that an expression's type is compatible with its expected
    type.</p>

<pre>
case e : Expression =>
    if (!iscompatible (e->tipe, e->exptipe))
        message (e, "expected " + (e->exptipe) + " type got " + (e->tipe))
</pre>

    <p>I followed the same scheme as in the practical exercises by
    defining an <code>iscompatible</code> method which compares the type
    and expected type for equality, but allows an unknown type in either
    place so that errors can be supressed when we don't care about the
    type or when there is another error that prevents a type from being
    calculated.</p>

<pre>
def iscompatible (t1 : Type, t2 : Type) : Boolean =
    (t1 == UnknownType ()) || (t2 == UnknownType ()) || (t1 == t2)
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 5: The type of a true or false expression is Boolean.</em></p>

    <p>To implement this rule I added cases for the true and false expressions
    to the tipe attribute as follows.</p>

<pre>
case _ : TrueExp | _ : FalseExp =>
    BooleanType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 6: The type of an identifier expression referring to a
    variable, argument or class is the declared type of the variable or
    argument (in the first two cases) or a reference type that refers to
    instances of that class (in the last case). Method names cannot be
    used by themselves in expressions; they can only be used in call
    expressions.</em></p>

    <p>This rule required a case for <code>tipe</code> at <code>IdnExp</code>
    nodes. The case looks at the entity associated with the identifier
    occurrence to determine what kind of entity it is, returning the
    appropriate type as specified in the rule. An important aspect was
    having a default case to specify an unknown type in the case when
    there is no sensible entity associated with the identifier occurrence.
    Otherwise, we will get spurious type errors when identifiers are
    not declared.</p>

<pre>
case IdnExp (i) =>
    (i->entity) match {
        case ClassEntity (decl) =>
            ReferenceType (decl)
        case ArgumentEntity (decl) =>
            actualTypeOf (decl.tipe)
        case VariableEntity (decl) =>
            actualTypeOf (decl.tipe)
        case _ =>
            UnknownType ()
    }
</pre>

    <p>Note that in the argument and variable entity cases we don't just
    use the type as found in the declaration. This is because if the
    type is a class type then that type will just refer to the name of
    the class. To be useful for type-checking, we really need to use a
    reference type that refers to the declaration of the named class.
    Thus, we use a helper method <code>actualTypeOf</code> that converts
    such types by looking up the entity of a named class.</p>

<pre>
def actualTypeOf (t : Type) : Type =
    t match {
        case ClassType (idn) =>
            (idn->entity) match {
                case ClassEntity (decl) =>
                    ReferenceType (decl)
                case _ =>
                    UnknownType ()
            }
        case _ =>
            t
    }
</pre>

    <p>In the non-class type cases, the type in the declaration is the
    same as the internal type for type checking, so we just leave it
    alone.</p>

    <p><code>actualTypeOf</code> will be used by later cases for the
    same reason.</p>

    <p><em>Rule 7: The condition in an if-statement or while-statement
    must be of type Boolean.</em></p>

    <p>This rule required updating the <code>exptipe</code> attribute
    to have a case for when the parent of an expression is an if or
    while statement node.</p>

<pre>
case _ : If | _ : While =>
    BooleanType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 8: The expression in a println-statement can be of any
    type.</em></p>

    <p>This rule was handled by a catch-all case for <code>exptipe</code>
    that returned the unknown type for expressions that are not covered
    by other cases.</p>

<pre>
case _ =>
    UnknownType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 9: In a variable assignment statement, the name on the
    left-hand side must refer to a variable or argument. The type of
    the expression on the right-hand side must be the same as that of
    the variable or argument.</em></p>

    <p>This rule required <code>exptipe</code> to have a case for
    variable assignment nodes. There are two sub-cases: one for
    normal variables and one for method arguments. In each case
    the expected type can be extracted from the respective entity.
    As for rule 6, we have a default case that returns an unknown
    type when we don't know the entity on the left-hand side of an
    assignment.</p>

<pre>
case VarAssign (lhs, _) =>
    (lhs->entity) match {
        case VariableEntity (Var (t, _)) =>
            actualTypeOf (t)
        case ArgumentEntity (Argument (t, _)) =>
            actualTypeOf (t)
        case _ =>
            UnknownType ()
    }
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 10: In an array assignment statement or index expression,
    the base sub-expression must be of integer array type and the index
    sub-expression must be of integer type. In the assignment case, the
    type of the right-hand side sub-expression must be integer. In the
    index expression case the type of the sub-expression is integer.</em></p>

    <p>This rule is handled similarly to the other cases for the expected
    type. The difference is that an array assignment contains three
    expression children. We need to have one case for each of these
    expressions so the cases require guards to discriminate between
    them.</p>

<pre>
case ArrAssign (base, _, _) if base eq e =>
    IntArrayType ()

case ArrAssign (_, index, _) if index eq e =>
    IntType ()

case ArrAssign (_, _, elem) if elem eq e =>
    IntType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rules 11: In plus, minus and star expressions, the types of
    both sub-expressions must be integer. The type of the expression is
    integer. Rule 12: In a logical AND expression, the types of both
    sub-expressions must be Boolean. The type of the expression is Boolean.
    Rule 13: In a logical NOT expresion, the type of the sub-expression
    must be Boolean. The type of the expression is Boolean. Rule 14: In
    a less-than expression, the types of both sub-expressions must be
    integer. The type of the expression is Boolean. Rule 15: In a length
    expression, the type of the base sub-expression must be integer
    array. The type of the expression is integer.</em></p>

    <p>Rule 11 was already implemented in the skeleton. The other rules
    are handled similarly, by these cases in the <code>tipe</code>
    attribute definition:</p>

<pre>
// Rule 11
case _ : PlusExp | _ : MinusExp | _ : StarExp =>
    IntType ()

// Rule 12
case _ : AndExp =>
    BooleanType ()

// Rule 13
case _ : NotExp =>
    BooleanType ()

// Rule 14
case _ : LessExp =>
    BooleanType ()

// Rule 15
case _ : LengthExp =>
    IntType ()
</pre>

    <p>and by these cases in the <code>exptipe</code> attribute
    definition:</p>

<pre>
// Rule 11
case _ : PlusExp | _ : MinusExp | _ : StarExp =>
    IntType ()

// Rule 12
case _ : AndExp =>
    BooleanType ()

// Rule 13
case _ : NotExp =>
    BooleanType ()

// Rule 14
case _ : LessExp =>
    IntType ()

// Rule 15
case _ : LengthExp =>
    IntArrayType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 17: The type of a this expression is a reference to an
    instance of the class in which the this expression occurs.</em></p>

    <p>This rule required a bit more work. The reason is that the type
    that we need is not constant, nor is it directly obtainable from
    the <code>ThisExp</code> node. What we need to do is to look upwards
    in the tree to find the nearest enclosing <code>Class</code> node.
    The type of <code>this</code> will be a reference to that class
    type. I implmented the search in a new <code>thistype</code>
    attribute and use it in the <code>ThisExp</code> case of the
    <code>tipe</code> attribute.</p>

<pre>
case e : ThisExp =>
    e->thistype
</pre>

    <p>The <code>thistype</code> attribute has three cases. If we are
    at the root then we have not found a class, so we return the
    unknown type. If we are at a class node then we return it.
    Otherwise, we just search up the tree by asking our parent what
    its <code>thistype</code> is.</p>

<pre>
lazy val thistype : SourceNode => Type =
    attr {
        case n if n.isRoot =>
            UnknownType ()

        case decl : Class =>
            ReferenceType (decl)

        case n =>
            (n.parent[SourceNode])->thistype

    }
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 18: In a new array expression the type of the sub-expression
    must be integer. The type of the new array expression is integer array.
    </em></p>

    <p>These rules are again straight-forward. <code>tipe</code> just returns
    an integer array type in the new array expression case.</p>

<pre>
case _ : NewArrExp =>
    IntArrayType ()
</pre>

    <p>The <code>exptipe</code> attribute needs a case to restrict the
    expression in a new array creation expression to be of integer
    type.</p>

<pre>
case _ : NewArrExp =>
    IntType ()
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 19: In a new instance expression the name used must refer
    to a normal class. The type of the expression is a reference to an
    instance of that class.</em></p>

    <p>As for some of the earlier cases, we just get the entity referred
    to by a name in a new expression. In <code>check</code> we have a
    case to complain if the entity that is used in such an expression is
    not referring to a class entity. Note that this test automatically
    rules out the main class since a different kind of entity is used
    for that one. As usual, we don't raise an error if the entity is
    unknown.</p>

<pre>
case e : Expression =>
    ...
    e match {
        ...
        case NewExp (u) =>
            (u->entity) match {
                // Rule 19
                case _ : ClassEntity =>
                    // Do nothing
                case ent =>
                    if (ent != UnknownEntity)
                        message (u, "illegal instance creation of non-class type")
            }
        ...
    }
</pre>

    <p>The <code>NewExp</code> case of <code>tipe</code> just looks up
    the entity and makes a reference type if the a class is being
    referred to. Otherwise, we return the unknown type.</p>

<pre>
case NewExp (i) =>
    (i->entity) match {
        case ClassEntity (decl) =>
            ReferenceType (decl)
        case _ =>
            UnknownType ()
    }
</pre>

    <h3>Part One: Testing</h3>

    <p><em>As in Assignment One, there are many, many tests that we
    could write for our semantic analysis. It is difficult to know
    when we have been complete enough. What you will find in the
    sample solution is a pretty complete attempt, but there are
    still more tests that we could imagine having. For marking,
    we wanted to see that you had put some effort into considering
    completeness, not necessarily going as far as could be done.</em>

    <p>Testing semantic analysis checking is really a matter of making
    sure the tests cover positive cases (i.e., code that passes the
    checks) as well as negative cases (i.e., code that violates the
    checks). For some semantic rules, there is only a positive case
    since there is no way for an input program to violate the rule
    (e.g., rule 4).</p>

    <p>With these basic principles in place, in each case it is best
    to construct the tests so that each one tests a single semantic
    rule in either positive mode, or where applicable, negative mode.
    This approach was followed in the skeleton which provided tests
    for rules 1, 2, 4 and 11.</p>

    <p>I reused the skeleton test framework to embed expressions
    into a dummy class so that they could be parsed and analysed.
    I extended this idea to allow variable declarations and statements
    to be optionally embedded into the class as well. This capability
    was needed to test some of the more complex rules that involve
    statements and classes.  This extension resulted in an a
    <code>embedExpressionAndCheck</code> method which has the
    following signature.</p>

<pre>
def embedExpressionAndCheck (exp : Expression,
                             retType : Type = IntType (),
                             vars : List[Var] = Nil,
                             stmts : List[Statement] = Nil)
</pre>

    <p>For example, the first test below declares an integer
    variable <code>v</code> and uses it in an assignment statement to
    make sure that an integer expression can be assigned to it. This
    is a positive test since we expect no error. The second test
    below is similar, but tests the negative condition since the
    variable is of integer type but the expression is Boolean.
    Most of the tests follow this pattern.</p>

<pre>
test ("an integer expression is assignment compatible with an integer var") {
    val exp = IntExp (0) // dummy
    val exp1 = IntExp (42)
    val vars = List (Var (IntType (), IdnDef ("v")))
    val stmts = List (VarAssign (IdnUse ("v"), exp1))
    embedExpressionAndCheck (exp, vars, stmts)
    assert (messagecount === 0)
}

test ("a Boolean expression is not assignment compatible with an integer var") {
    val exp = IntExp (0) // dummy
    val exp1 = TrueExp ()
    val vars = List (Var (IntType (), IdnDef ("v")))
    val stmts = List (VarAssign (IdnUse ("v"), exp1))
    embedExpressionAndCheck (exp, IntType (), vars, stmts)
    assert (messagecount === 1)
    assertMessage (0, 0, 0, "expected int type got boolean")
}
</pre>

    <p>In a few places tests are hard-coded as a program where that is
    possible. For example, to check that the type of <code>this</code> is
    the current class type, we just have a simple program with a method
    that returns that type. This test uses the skeleton's <code>parseTest</code>
    method.</p>

<pre>
test ("the type of this is the current class") {
    parseTest ("""
        |class Dummy { public static void main () { System.out.println (0); } }
        |class Test {
        |    public Test m () {
        |        return this;
        |    }
        |}
        """.stripMargin)
    assert (messagecount === 0)
}
</pre>

    <h3>Part Two: The more complex semantic rules</h3>

    <p>Part Two involved implementing the remaining semantic checks,
    namely those for rules 3, 16 and 20. As before, I discuss how
    each of these was achieved, before considering testing.</p>

    <p><em>Rule 20: The type of the return expression in a method must be
    the same as the declared return type of the method.</em></p>

    <p>Of the rules in Part Two, rule 20 is the easiest since it follows the
    same pattern as those in Part One. A return expression occurs directly
    as a child of the method body node. The body node contains the return
    type of the method as a field. Thus, the relevant case of
    <code>exptipe</code> just has to extract it and return it (after
    making sure it is an actual type as we have done before).</p>

<pre>
case MethodBody (t, _, _, _, _) =>
    actualTypeOf (t)
</pre>

    <p><em>Rule 16: In a method call expression the named entity
    that is being called must be a method of the class whose instance is
    referenced by the base expression (or in a superclass if that class has
    no method with the given name). The number of arguments supplied in the call
    and their types must be the same as the number of arguments and argument
    types required by the called method. The type of the expression is
    the return type of the method.</em></p>

    <p><em>Rule 3: If a defining occurence of an applied identifier is not
    found in the class in which that applied occurrence appears, and the
    class has a superclass, then the search moves to the superclass. If that
    class has no definition for the identifier and has a superclass, the
    search moves to that superclass. And so on until the definition is
    found or the superclass chain is exhausted.</em></p>

    <p>The main problem with processing method calls is that the skeleton
    code for the <code>entity</code> attribute only knows how to look up
    names in the current environment. For a call like <code>o.m</code>
    we need to look <code>m</code> up in the definition of the class of
    <code>o</code>, not in the current environment. Thus, we need to add
    a case for identifiers that occur as the child of a call expression.
    We make use of the <code>HasParent</code> pattern to do this check,
    but you could also do it with an explicit check of the parent of the
    identifier use just the same.</p>

<pre>
lazy val entity : IdnNode => MiniJavaEntity =
    attr {

        case HasParent (n @ IdnUse (i), CallExp (base, _, _)) =>
            (base->tipe) match {
                case ReferenceType (decl) =>
                    lookup (decl->env, i, UnknownEntity)  /* *** */
                case t =>
                    UnknownEntity
            }
        case n =>
            lookup (n->env, n.idn, UnknownEntity)

    }
</pre>

    <p>For rule 3, we must deal with superclass lookups. We extend the code
    we just saw for looking up methods, to look in the superclass if there
    is one if a method name is not found. The checking will actually be done
    by a helper method <code>findMethod</code>, we replace the line marked
    by <code>/* *** */</code> with the following call.</p>

<pre>
findMethod (decl, i)
</pre>

    <p>We first lookup in the environment of <code>decl</code>. If it's there,
    we are done. Otherwise, we look to see if <code>decl</code> has a superclass
    clause. If so, we check to make sure that the named used in the superclass
    clause, actually refers to a class, since it could be undefined or some
    other named entity, for example. If it's a class, then we recursively call
    <code>findMethod</code> to look in the superclass. If there is no superclass
    clause, or the thing named there is not a class, we bail out by returning
    the unknown entity.</p>

<pre>
def findMethod (decl : Class, i : String) : MiniJavaEntity =
    lookup (decl->env, i, UnknownEntity) match {

        case UnknownEntity =>
            decl.superclass match {
                case Some (superidn) =>
                    (superidn->entity) match {
                        case ClassEntity (superdecl) =>
                            findMethod (superdecl, i)
                        case _ =>
                            UnknownEntity
                    }
                case None =>
                    UnknownEntity
            }

        case entity =>
            // Found it in decl's env, so return it
            entity

    }
</pre>

    <p>In our first cut at checking for rule 16, we have a check whose purpose is to
    ensure that a call expression can only make a call to a method entity.</p>

<pre>
case e : Expression =>
    ...
    e match {
        ...
        case CallExp (_, u, args) =>
            (u->entity) match {
                // Rule 16
                case _ : MethodEntity =>
                    // Do nothing
                case ent =>
                    if (ent != UnknownEntity)
                        message (u, "illegal call to non-method")
            }
        ...
    }
</pre>

    <p>To support the checking of method arguments, the "Do nothing" code
    here needs to make an additional check.

<pre>
    val expargnum = decl.body.args.length
    if (expargnum != args.length)
        message (u, "wrong number of arguments, got " +
                     args.length + " but expected " +
                     expargnum)
</pre>

    <p>The <code>tipe</code> attribute has a case that specifies the type
    of a call expression to be the return type of the called method (or
    unknown if the called identifier is not referring to a method).</p>

<pre>
case CallExp (_, i, _) =>
    (i->entity) match {
        case MethodEntity (decl) =>
            actualTypeOf (decl.body.tipe)
        case _ =>
            UnknownType ()
    }
</pre>

    <p>We also need to specify the expected type of each argument in a
    call expression. In the <code>exptipe</code> attribute case for an
    expression whose parent is a call expression, if we are calling a
    method we use a helper methoed <code>expTypeOfArg</code> to work
    out what the type of the argument. We somehow need to know which
    argument in the argument list the expression <code>e</code> is,
    so we use a Kiama node property <code>e.index</code> for this
    purpose. (An alternative method would be to write a method that
    searches the argument list for <code>e</code> and returns the
    position where it was found.)</p>

<pre>
case CallExp (_, u, _) =>
    (u->entity) match {
        case MethodEntity (decl) =>
            expTypeOfArg (decl, e.index)

        case _ =>
            // No idea what is being called, so no type constraint
            UnknownType ()
    }
</pre>

    <p><code>expTypeOfArg</code> looks up the formal argument if the
    actual argument is in range and returns the relevant actual type.
    Note that the base expression and method name are counted in the
    index count, so we need to subtract two from the index to get the
    zero-indexed argument number.</p>

<pre>
def expTypeOfArg (method : Method, index : Int) : Type = {
    val argnum = index - 2
    val numargs = method.body.args.length
    if (argnum &lt; numargs) {
        val arg = method.body.args (argnum)
        actualTypeOf (arg.tipe)
    } else
        UnknownType ()
}
</pre>

    <h3>Part Two: Testing</h3>

    <p>Testing was undertaken using the same principles as for the first part
    of the assignment. The only real difference is that in these tests it is
    natural to test multiple things at once. For example, to test that the
    type of a call expression is correct, we are also testing that the
    method name is looked up properly. Here is the positive test.</p>

<pre>
test ("the type of a method call expression is the method return type (1)") {
    parseTest ("""
        |class Dummy { public static void main () { System.out.println (0); } }
        |class Test {
        |    int v;
        |    public int m () {
        |        return 42;
        |    }
        |    public int n () {
        |        v = this.m ();
        |        return 0;
        |    }
        |}
        """.stripMargin)
    assert (messagecount === 0)
}
</pre>
