    <h2>COMP332 Programming Languages 2012<br>
  Assignment One (Sample Solution)</h2>

    <p>This assignment concerned the design, development, testing, and
    documentation of a syntax analyser for a simple MiniJava version of
    the Java programming language. We had to implement a lexical
    analyser, parser, and tree builder for the language, building on the
    skeleton code. Also, we had to design test cases to demonstrate that
    our implementation is working correctly.</p>

    <p>This report presents the design and implementation of my syntax
    analyser and describes the design of the tests I have used to
    check the correctness of the implementation. Parts One and Two are
    discussed separately. The full code for this sample solution is on
    the COMP332 iLearn site.</p>

    <h3>Part One: Design and implementation</h3>

    <p>I first describe the design and implementation of the parsing
    code, without consideration of tree building. The second
    sub-section adds tree building to the parsing code.</p>

    <h4>Parsing</h4>

    <p>My parser design follows the method discussed in lectures. Each
    context-free grammar production translates into a Scala parser
    value whose definition mimics the production. Operators in the
    grammar translate into their equivalents from the Scala parsing
    library.</p>

    <p>I use lazy values to define my parsers so that I don't have to
    worry about the order in which I define them. An alternative would
    be to use non-lazy vals and be careful about the order, but this
    harder to write.</p>

    <p>The translation from the grammar to the parsers is mostly
    straight-forward. For example, the productions</p>

<pre>
Arguments         : Type Identifier ("," Type Identifier)*
                  | /* empty */.

Statement         : "{" Statement* "}"
                  | "if" "(" Expression ")" Statement "else" Statement
                  | "while" "(" Expression ")" Statement
                  | "System.out.println" "(" Expression ")" ";"
                  | Identifier "=" Expression ";"
                  | Identifier "[" Expression "]" "=" Expression ";".
</pre>

    <p>become</p>

<pre>
lazy val arguments =
    repsep (argument, ",")

lazy val argument =
    tipe ~ identifier

lazy val statement =
    "{" ~> (statement*) <~ "}" |
    "if" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") ~ statement ~ ("else" ~> statement) |
    "while" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") ~ statement |
    "System.out.println" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") <~ ";" |
    identifier ~ ("=" ~> expression) <~ ";" |
    identifier ~ ("[" ~> expression <~ "]") ~ ("=" ~> expression) <~ ";"
</pre>

    <p>The <code>repsep</code> method used in the <code>arguments</code>
    definition builds a parser where input parsed by the first parser is
    separated by instances of input parsed by the second parser, allowing
    no repetitions at all. Thus, this is equivalent to the two alternatives
    for this symbol given in the grammar.</p>

    <p>Appropriate bracketing and the <code><~</code> and <code>~></code>
    operators are used in the productions to make sure that we throw away
    the values of the literal strings and just retain the values of the
    components that need to end up in the tree. A more complex case of
    this occurs in the parsers for <code>ClassDeclaration</code> which
    we solve by bracketing each pair of components.</p>

<pre>
lazy val classDeclaration =
    ("class" ~> identifier) ~ (("extends" ~> identifier)?) ~
        ("{" ~> (varDeclaration*)) ~ ((methodDeclaration*) <~ "}")
</pre>

    <p>Similar translations implement the other productions.</p>

    <p>The expression parsers follow the approach described in lectures
    to describe the precedence and associativity of operators. We
    were given the <code>factor</code> parser. I added
    <code>expression0</code> for multiplication,
    <code>expression1</code> for addition and subtraction,
    <code>expression2</code> for less-than and
    <code>expression</code> for Boolean AND, in decreasing order
    of precedence.</p>

    <p>The parsers for the terminal symbols of the grammar (which
    effectively implement the lexical analysis) follow their natural
    language descriptions, since the assignment did not give
    productions for them. No conversion is needed since the string
    value returned by these parsers is what we want to return to the
    expression parser.</p>

<pre>
lazy val integer : PackratParser[String] =
    regex ("[0-9]+".r)

lazy val identifier : PackratParser[String] =
    regex ("[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*".r)
</pre>

    <h4>Tree building</h4>

    <p>The skeleton provided the tree structure that we were to
    produce. Adding tree building to my parsing code followed the
    method discussed in lectures. Each parser was augmented with a
    tree construction action to build the appropriate tree fragment
    from the components recognised by its component parsers.</p>

    <p>In almost all cases, the tree building action simply constructs
    a node of the appropriate case class using the <code>^^</code>
    operator, since the components correspond directly to the case
    class constructor arguments.</p>

    <p>For example, the parsers from the previous section become the
    following when types and tree building actions are added.</p>

<pre>
lazy val arguments : PackratParser[List[Argument]] =
    repsep (argument, ",")

lazy val argument : PackratParser[Argument] =
    tipe ~ identifier ^^ {
        case t ~ n =>
            Argument (t, n)
    }

lazy val statement : PackratParser[Statement] =
    "{" ~> (statement*) <~ "}" ^^ {
        case ss =>
            Block (ss)
    } |
    "if" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") ~ statement ~ ("else" ~> statement) ^^ {
        case e ~ s1 ~ s2 =>
            If (e, s1, s2)
    } |
    "while" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") ~ statement ^^ {
        case e ~ s =>
            While (e, s)
    } |
    "System.out.println" ~> ("(" ~> expression <~ ")") <~ ";" ^^ {
        case e =>
            Println (e)
    } |
    identifier ~ ("=" ~> expression) <~ ";" ^^ {
        case n ~ e =>
            VarAssign (n, e)
    } |
    identifier ~ ("[" ~> expression <~ "]") ~ ("=" ~> expression) <~ ";" ^^ {
        case n ~ i ~ e =>
            ArrAssign (n, i, e)
    }
</pre>


    <h3>Part One: Testing</h3>

    <p><em>Note regarding marking: I am aware that proper testing for
    this assignment was quite a bit of work. We did not expect the
    level of testing described below for a good mark, but it is
    worthwhile to bear in mind that without this kind of testing,
    any confidence you have in the correct operation of your program
    is probably mis-placed.</em></p>

    <p>I used all of the MiniJava example programs from the MiniJava web
    site as general tests. My parser correctly handles all of these
    files, which gives me some confidence that things are ok, particularly
    combniations of many constructs and handling of whitespace and
    comments. These tests are somewhat unsatisfactory, however, since
    they cannot be run and checked automatically by sbt. Hence, we want
    to be as complete as practical in the sbt tests.</p>

    <p>I designed positive tests (correct input) based on the possible
    alternatives in the grammar, to make sure that I had all of the bases
    covered for correct programs. I tried to make each test just test
    one thing. For example, there is no need to test all sorts of
    expressions as a while statement condition, since there will be
    tests of expressions elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Consider the terminal symbols, starting with
    identifiers. The skeleton already had a test for a normal identifier
    containing multiple letters. Missing were a minimal test (an identifier
    with just one letter) and one that tested inclusion of digits and
    underscores. There was already a negative test for parsing an
    integer as an identifier. I added two more to make check that
    sequences that start with a digit or underscore, but otherwise
    are ok as identifiers, are not allowed. Similar tests were
    written for integer terminals, although there are less possibilites
    to test since integers have a simpler structure.</p>

    <p>For non-terminal constructs, I used the following general
    procedure for designing test cases. Constructs that involve no
    alternatives (including repetition) just need one test case.
    Where alternatives are present, I made sure to have at least
    one test case for each alternative. Repetitions are a special
    case of alternation. For each repetition, I designed tests to
    deal with the lower boundary conditions (empty or single case).
    Upper boundary conditions of repetitions were infinite, so they
    cannot be tested, but I made sure to have tests of multiple
    repetitions for each situation. For possibly empty repetitions
    I also have a test case for a single element, since a common
    error to make is to forget the repetition completely.</p>

    <p>As an example, consider the following production.</p>

<pre>
ClassDeclaration  : "class" Identifier ("extends" Identifier)? {"
                       VarDeclaration*
                       MethodDeclaration*
                    "}".
</pre>

    <p>We need two tests of the class header, one that has an
    <code>extends</code> clause and one that doesn't. To deal
    with the repetitions, we need to account for nothing in the
    body, one of each repetition or more than one of each repetition.
    Considering all of the combinations leads to quite a few
    tests, but they are routine.</p>

    <p>Expression testing requires a little more work, since the
    precedence and associativity rules for binary operators are
    not encoded in the grammar that we were given.  Hence, I
    included some extra tests to make sure that the operators
    were all associative in the correct way and that expressions
    with multiple operators correctly took into account the
    relative precedence of those operators. Also, I checked that
    parentheses correctly override the associativity and
    precedence rules. For the less than operator I have a negative
    test to make sure that it is not associative.</p>

    <p>I didn't test all of the combinations of binary operators
    for precedence ordering, but I tested each step in the precedence
    hierarchy. By transitivity, the other cases should be covered
    as well. For example,
    I test that <code>*</code> has higher precedence than <code>+</code>
    and that <code>+</code> has higher precedence than <code><</code>.
    From these two tests we can be reasonable sure that <code>*</code>
    has higher precedence than <code><</code>.</p>

    <p>Testing negative conditions (erroneous input) is harder since
    there are a lot more possibilities. I limited my testing to the
    cases that were likely possibilities for errors. For example, where
    a repetition called for one or more of something, I tested to make
    sure that the wrong number is not allowed. For example, a main class
    has to have exactly one statment, so I have negative tests for zero
    and more than one. Similarly, a method body has to have a return
    statement so I have a negative test to check that an empty body
    is not allowed. In general, the aim of negative tests is to spot
    places where it is likely that an error has been made.</p>

    <p>Overall, as usual we can't be sure that problems are still not
    present since we can't test every possible input combination.
    However, the combinations I have tried work, plus the fact that the
    more complex actual MiniJava progams are handled correctly, means
    that I have a high level of confidence that this program is working
    properly.</code>

    <h3>Part Two</h3>

    <p>The first task for Part Two was to research Java interfaces
    and to come up with a version that makes sense in the context
    of MiniJava.</p>

    <p>The main idea of Java interfaces is to provide a way to
    declare the signatures of methods without their bodies. Java
    classes can declare that they implement one or more interfaces,
    in which case they need to provide implementations for the
    the methods in those interfaces.</p>

    <p>The signature of a method comprises its name, its argument
    names and types, and its return type. A class declares that
    it implements an interface via an <code>implements</code>
    clause in its declaration. For example, the following is a
    declaration of an interface <code>Colourable</code> and a
    use of it by a <code>Shape</code> class, assuming the
    existence of a <code>Colour</code> class or interface.</p>

<pre>
interface Colourable {
    void setColour (Colour colour);
    Colour getColour ();
}

class Shape implements Colourable {

    void setColour (Colour colour) {
        ... implementation ...
    }

    Colour getColour () {
        ... implementation ...
    }

}
</pre>

    <p>Java interfaces have more aspects than this (e.g., a class
    can implement more than one interface), but I decided on this
    level of support since it fits with the rest of MiniJava.</p>

    <p>I then considered how to add interfaces to the syntax of
    MiniJava. By analogy to the existing syntax of classes and
    methods, I added these productions to the grammar.</p>

<pre>
InterfaceDeclaration :
    "interface" Identifier "{"
        SignatureDeclaration*
    "}".

SignatureDeclaration :
    "public" Type Identifier "(" Arguments ")" ";".
</pre>

    <p>To allow interface declarations to appear in a program,
    I modified the program production as follows.</p>

<pre>
Program : MainClass ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration*.

ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration :
      ClassDeclaration
    | InterfaceDeclaration.
</pre>

    <p>Finally, I modified class declarations to allow an optional
    implements clause after the optional extends clause.</p>

<pre>
ClassDeclaration :
    "class" Identifier ("extends" Identifier)? ("implements" Identifier)? {"
        VarDeclaration*
        MethodDeclaration*
    "}".
</pre>

    <p>To accomodate interfaces in the abstract syntax tree, I added a new
    tree node type for interfaces. It and <code>Class</code> share
    a new common superclass <code>ClassOrInterface</code> and a program is now
    a list of classes or interfaces. Also, <code>Class</code> got a new
    field to store its optional implements information, analogous to the
    existing field that stores the optional superclass. A new node type
    for signatures was added that is the same as for methods with the body
    components and return expression removed.</p>

<pre>
case class Program (main : MainClass,
                    classesOrInterfaces : List[ClassOrInterface]) extends SourceNode

sealed abstract class ClassOrInterface extends SourceNode

case class Class (name : String, superclass : Option[String],
                  implements : Option[String],
                  vars : List[Var], methods : List[Method]) extends ClassOrInterface

case class Interface (name : String, signatures : List[Signature]) extends ClassOrInterface

case class Signature (tipe : Type, name : String, args : List[Argument]) extends SourceNode
</pre>

    <p>Modifying the parser and tree construction to accommodate these new
    constructs or changes to old ones was straight-forward and proceeded as
    described in Part One. No new techniques were needed.</p>

    <p>Testing was undertaken as for the main part of the assignment. A set
    of tests similar to those for classes were added for interfaces, and
    tests for signature declarations were added similar to those already
    present for method declarations. Also, tests of the optional implements
    clause were added. A test of mixed classes and interfaces in a program was
    added.</p>
