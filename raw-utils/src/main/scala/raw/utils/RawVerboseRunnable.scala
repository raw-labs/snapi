/**
 * Wraps a Runnable to log any uncaught exceptions.
 *
 * This is useful for tasks that run on the background without any supervision from a parent thread, so that if they fail
 * with an exception, there is no one to catch and handle it. This is opposed to cases where some parent thread will handle
 * the result of the task, either by calling Future.get or by adding an error handling stage when using completable
 * futures.
 *
 * Inspired by
 * https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-log/blob/master/src/main/java/com/jcabi/log/VerboseRunnable.java
 * @param propagate Whether to rethrow the exception.
